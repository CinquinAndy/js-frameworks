Hooks

Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 and they let us use React's features-like managing your component's state and or performing an after effect when certain changes occur in state(s) without writing a class.

*useEffect Hook

useEffect is a special hook that lets you run side effects in React. It is similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, but it only runs when the component (or some of its props) changes and during the initial mount.

useState Hook

useState hook is used to manage the state of a component in functional components. Calling useState returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.

useRef

useRef is a React hook that provides a way to create a mutable reference that persists across component re-renders. It stores a value that doesn't cause re-renders when it changes.

useMemo

useMemo is a React hook that memoizes the result of a function. It is used to optimize performance by caching the result of a function and returning the cached result when the inputs to the function have not changed.

useCallback

useCallback is a React hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function. It's used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. Specifically, it helps avoid recreating functions when their dependencies haven't changed, which can be useful when passing callbacks to child components that rely on referential equality to prevent re-rendering.

useReducer

useReducer: An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If youâ€™re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)

useContext

The useContext Hook lets us share data between components without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree. This is particularly useful when many components need to access the same data or when components are deeply nested.
