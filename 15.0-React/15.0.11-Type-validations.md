Types & Validation

Typescript provides a static type system that helps you in avoiding mistakes during the development and provides other features (e.g. IDE support) that help you improve your productivity.

One thing you should note is that TypeScript can only help you avoid mistakes during the development. We can't rely on it to validate a client's input. Zod is a powerful validation library that allows us to validate: form input, local storage, API contracts and much more using their typesafe implementation.

Zod

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I'm using the term "schema" to broadly refer to any data type, from a simple string to a complex nested object.

Zod is designed to be as developer-friendly as possible. The goal is to eliminate duplicate type declarations. With Zod, you declare a validator once and Zod will automatically infer the static TypeScript type. It's easy to compose simpler types into complex data structures.
